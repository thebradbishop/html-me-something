                <p>I'm trying to get into the habit of leaving a Yelp review for the places I've been to eat. Especially the places I visit frequently. This assignment is just a small step in that directions.</p>

                <a href="http://hipointedrivein.com"><h2>Hi Pointe Drive In</h2></a>
                <img src="Images/hipointe.jpg" alt="Burger"/>
                <p>This place was crazy good! In fact we went twice in the first week it was open. Hi Pointe Drive In is located behind the Hi Pointe Theater on McCausland, this gem is worth the struggle you'll have trying to find a parking spot. They food is absolutely delicious and staff is very friendly. Go today and enjoy a one of a kind burger. You won't regret it!</p>

                <img src="Images/pi.jpg" alt="Pi Signage" />
                <p>I've eaten at Pi more times than I can count. This place is great. It's truly a St. Louis staple. The other St. Louis pizza chain can keep its provel to itself. I'll take Pi over Imo's anyday. Pi is so tasty in fact that it's rumored to be President Barack Obama's favorite pizza. They even opened a location in Washington D.C. There are several locations throughout the St. Louis area. Head to your nearest location for a great pizza!</p>
